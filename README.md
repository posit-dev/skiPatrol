skiPatrol is an R interface to the Snowflake ML platform -- Model Registry, Feature Store, Datasets, and SPCS model serving. It works in **local R environments** (RStudio, Positron, VS Code, terminal), the **Posit Native App**, and **Snowflake Workspace Notebooks**.

It is maintained by [Posit](https://posit.co) as a fork of
[Snowflake-Labs/snowflakeR](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowflakeR),
renamed and developed since the fork.

> **Companion package:** For standard DBI-compliant database access (`dbGetQuery`, `dbWriteTable`, `dbplyr`, RStudio Connections Pane, etc.), see [**skiLift**](https://github.com/posit-dev/skiLift). `skiPatrol` focuses on ML platform features; `skiLift` provides the database connectivity layer.

## Overview

**skiPatrol** provides idiomatic R functions for the full Snowflake ML lifecycle, whether you're working locally or directly inside Snowflake:

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Connect** | One-line connection via `connections.toml`, keypair, or Workspace auto-detect |
| **Query** | Run SQL via `sfr_query()` / `sfr_execute()`, read/write tables |
| **Model Registry** | Log R models, deploy to SPCS, warehouse & SQL-direct inference, aliases, export, batch inference, granular metrics |
| **Feature Store** | Entities, feature views (incl. online serving, Iceberg, aggregation), slicing, introspection, training data & datasets |
| **Model Monitoring** | Continuous drift, performance, and statistical monitoring of deployed models with segment support |
| **Experiment Tracking** | Track runs, log parameters/metrics/artifacts, integrate with `tune` grid search |
| **Datasets** | Versioned, immutable snapshots of query results for reproducible ML |
| **Admin** | Manage compute pools, image repos, and external access integrations |
| **REST Inference** | Pure-R prediction against SPCS service endpoints via `sfr_predict_rest()` |
| **Parallel / SPCS R** | `foreach` via `registerDoSnowflake()` (local, Tasks, Hybrid Table queue); stage scripts with `sfr_run_executor()`; optional `crew` + `mirai` workers via `crew_controller_spcs()` |
| **Workspace Notebooks** | First-class support for Snowflake Workspace Notebooks with zero-config auth and `%%R` magic cells |
| **RStudio on SPCS** | Deploy kit for RStudio Server as a custom SPCS service (`inst/rstudio-spcs/`) |

Under the hood, `skiPatrol` uses [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) to bridge to the [`snowflake-ml-python`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/index) SDK while exposing a native R API with `snake_case` naming, S3 classes, and `cli` messaging. The same code runs identically in local R sessions and Snowflake Workspace Notebooks.

### RStudio Server on SPCS

For a **native RStudio IDE** inside Snowflake (not `%%R` notebooks), use the deploy kit shipped in this package:

```r
system.file("rstudio-spcs", package = "skiPatrol")
```

Walkthrough: [Piste Guide — RStudio Server on SPCS](https://posit-dev.github.io/skiPatrol/04b_rstudio_spcs/index.html).  
Vignettes: `vignette("rstudio-spcs")`, `vignette("spcs-custom-services", package = "skiLift")`.

### DBI / dbplyr

For full DBI compliance, `dbplyr` integration, and the RStudio Connections Pane, use the companion **skiLift** package. You can obtain a `skiLift` connection from an existing `sfr_connection`:

```r
dbi_con <- sfr_dbi_connection(conn)  # lazy, cached on first call
DBI::dbGetQuery(dbi_con, "SELECT 1")

library(dplyr)
tbl(dbi_con, "MY_TABLE") |> filter(score > 90) |> collect()
```

Or connect directly with skiLift:

```r
library(DBI)
library(skiLift)
con <- dbConnect(Snowflake(), name = "my_profile")
```

## Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("posit-dev/skiPatrol")
```

### Python dependencies

skiPatrol requires Python >= 3.9 with the Snowflake ML packages:

```r
# Let skiPatrol install them into a dedicated virtualenv
skiPatrol::sfr_install_python_deps()
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install snowflake-ml-python snowflake-snowpark-python
```

## Quick start

```r
library(skiPatrol)

# Connect (reads ~/.snowflake/connections.toml by default)
conn <- sfr_connect()

# Run a query
df <- sfr_query(conn, "SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT 10")

# Log an R model to the Model Registry
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)
reg   <- sfr_model_registry(conn)
sfr_log_model(reg, model, model_name = "MPG_MODEL", version = "V1")

# Create a Feature Store entity and feature view
fs <- sfr_feature_store(conn)
sfr_create_entity(fs, name = "CUSTOMER", join_keys = "CUSTOMER_ID")
fv <- sfr_create_feature_view(
  fs,
  name       = "CUSTOMER_FEATURES",
  entity     = "CUSTOMER",
  source_sql = "SELECT customer_id, avg_spend, tenure FROM feature_table"
)
sfr_register_feature_view(fs, fv, version = "V1")
```

## Snowflake Workspace Notebooks

skiPatrol is designed to work seamlessly inside [Snowflake Workspace Notebooks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks). It auto-detects the Workspace environment, connects via the active session token (no credentials needed), and supports the `%%R` magic cell pattern for mixing Python and R:

```r
# In a Workspace Notebook %%R cell -- zero-config connection
library(skiPatrol)
conn <- sfr_connect()   # auto-detects Workspace session

# All skiPatrol functions work identically
df <- sfr_query(conn, "SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT 10")
reg <- sfr_model_registry(conn)
fs  <- sfr_feature_store(conn)
```

The package also provides `rprint()`, `rview()`, `rglimpse()`, and `rcat()` helpers for rich output rendering in Workspace cells. See `vignette("workspace-notebooks")` for setup instructions and tips for the dual local/Workspace workflow.

> **Note:** Workspace Notebooks do [not auto-set database or schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-in-workspaces/notebooks-in-workspaces-edit-run#set-the-execution-context).
> Use `setup_notebook()` from `sfnb_setup.py` to set session context
> automatically (from the YAML config or session defaults), and
> `sfr_fqn()` to build fully qualified table names
> (`DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE`). See the example notebooks below.

## Example Notebooks

`skiPatrol` ships with a **self-contained `notebooks/` directory** that has
everything you need to get started, including the bootstrap script and
per-notebook config files:

```r
# Find the notebooks directory in the installed package
system.file("notebooks", package = "skiPatrol")

# Or copy the entire folder to your working directory
nb_dir <- system.file("notebooks", package = "skiPatrol")
file.copy(list.files(nb_dir, full.names = TRUE), ".", recursive = TRUE)
```

For **Workspace Notebooks**, upload the folder contents to your Workspace and
open `workspace_quickstart.ipynb`. For **local** environments, open
`local_quickstart.ipynb`.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `workspace_quickstart.ipynb` | Quickstart for Snowflake Workspace Notebooks |
| `local_quickstart.ipynb` | Quickstart for local R environments |
| `workspace_model_registry.ipynb` | Model Registry: log, deploy, serve R models (Workspace) |
| `local_model_registry.ipynb` | Model Registry for local environments |
| `workspace_model_consumption.ipynb` | Consume Python models from R: warehouse inference via `sfr_predict_sql()` |
| `workspace_model_monitoring.ipynb` | Model Monitoring: drift, performance, statistics, segments |
| `workspace_feature_store.ipynb` | Feature Store: entities, views, training data (Workspace) |
| `local_feature_store.ipynb` | Feature Store for local environments |
| `workspace_forecasting_demo.ipynb` | Time series (ARIMA) with custom `predict` logic (Workspace) |
| `local_forecasting_demo.ipynb` | Forecasting demo for local environments |
| `workspace_credit_risk_setup.ipynb` / `workspace_credit_risk_demo.ipynb` | Credit risk: data prep, training, registry (Workspace) |
| `workspace_parallel_spcs_setup.ipynb` | Parallel SPCS lab: synthetic data and setup (`skipatrol_parallel_spcs_config.yaml`) |
| `workspace_parallel_spcs_demo.ipynb` | Parallel SPCS lab: driver (tasks / queue patterns) |
| `workspace_parallel_spcs_monitor.ipynb` | Parallel SPCS lab: SQL monitoring while the driver runs |
| `workspace_dosnowflake.ipynb` | doSnowflake walkthrough (Workspace) |
| `sfnb_setup.py` | All-in-one bootstrap: EAI, R runtime, packages, context (Workspace) |
| `skipatrol_*.yaml` | Per-notebook configs (see `inst/notebooks/README.md` for the full list) |
| `PARALLEL_SPCS_DEMO.md` | Design notes for the parallel SPCS lab |
| `streamlit_parallel_demo_monitor.py` | Optional Streamlit monitor for the parallel lab |

For Workspace Notebooks, the first cell runs `setup_notebook()` which
handles EAI validation, R installation, package installation, and session
context automatically. No separate config copy step is needed -- edit the
`_config.yaml` directly or rely on session defaults.
